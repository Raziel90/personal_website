abstract: Modern service robots are provided with one or more sensors, often
  including RGB-D cameras, to perceive objects and humans in the environment.
  This paper proposes a new system for the recognition of human social
  activities from a continuous stream of RGB-D data. Many of the works until now
  have succeeded in recognising activities from clipped videos in datasets, but
  for robotic applications it is important to be able to move to more realistic
  scenarios in which such activities are not manually selected. For this reason,
  it is useful to detect the time intervals when humans are performing social
  activities, the recognition of which can contribute to trigger human-robot
  interactions or to detect situations of potential danger. The main
  contributions of this research work include a novel system for the recognition
  of social activities from continuous RGB-D data, combining temporal
  segmentation and classification, as well as a model for learning the
  proximity-based priors of the social activities. A new public dataset with
  RGB-D videos of social and individual activities is also provided and used for
  evaluating the proposed solutions. The results show the good performance of
  the system in recognising social activities from continuous RGB-D data.
