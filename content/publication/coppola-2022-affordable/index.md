abstract: Using robot manipulators in contexts where it is undesirable or
  impractical for humans to physically intervene is crucial for several
  applications, from manufacturing to extreme environments. However, robots
  require a high degree of intelligence to operate in those environments,
  especially if they are not fully structured. Teleoperation compensates for
  this limitation by connecting the human operator to the robot using
  human-robot interfaces. The remotely operated sessions can also be used as
  demonstrations to program more powerful autonomous agents. In this article, we
  report a thorough user study to characterise the effect of simple vibrotactile
  feedback on the performance and cognitive load of the human user in performing
  teleoperated grasping and manipulation tasks. The experiments are performed
  using a portable and affordable bilateral teleoperation system that we
  designed, composed of a Leap Motion sensor and a custom-designed vibrotactile
  haptic glove to operate a 4-fingered robot hand equipped with 3-axis force
  sensors on the fingertips; the software packages we developed are open-source
  and publicly available. Our results show that vibrotactile feedback improves
  teleoperation and reduces cognitive load, especially for complex in-hand
  manipulation tasks.
