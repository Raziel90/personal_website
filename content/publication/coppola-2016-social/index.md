abstract: "Social activity based on body motion is a key feature for non-verbal
  and physical behavior defined as function for communicative signal and social
  interaction between individuals. Social activity recognition is important to
  study human-human communication and also human-robot interaction. Based on
  that, this research has threefold goals: (1) recognition of social behavior
  (e.g. human-human interaction) using a probabilistic approach that merges
  spatio-temporal features from individual bodies and social features from the
  relationship between two individuals; (2) learn priors based on physical
  proximity between individuals during an interaction using proxemics theory to
  feed a probabilistic ensemble of activity classifiers; and (3) provide a
  public dataset with RGB-D data of social daily activities including risk
  situations useful to test approaches for assisted living, since this type of
  dataset is still missing. Results show that using the proposed approach
  designed to merge features with different semantics and proximity priors
  improves the classification performance in terms of precision, recall and
  accuracy when compared with other approaches that employ alternative
  strategies."
