abstract: 'Distributed sensor arrays capable of detecting mul-
tiple spatially distributed stimuli are considered an important
element in the realisation of exteroceptive and proprioceptive
soft robots. This paper expands upon the previously presented
idea of decoupling the measurements of pressure and location
of a local indentation from global deformation, using the overall
stretch experienced by a soft capacitive e-skin. We employed
machine learning methods to decouple and predict these highly
coupled deformation stimuli, collecting data from a soft sensor
e-skin which was then fed to a machine learning system
comprising of linear regressor, gaussian process regressor, SVM
and random forest classifier for stretch, force, detection and
localisation respectively. We also studied how the localisation
and forces are affected when two forces are applied simultane-
ously. Soft sensor arrays aided by appropriately chosen machine
learning techniques can pave the way to e-skins capable of
deciphering multi-modal stimuli in soft robots.'
