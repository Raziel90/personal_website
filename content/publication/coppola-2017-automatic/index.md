abstract: "We present a system for temporal detection of social interactions.
  Many of the works until now have succeeded in recognising activities from
  clipped videos in datasets, but for robotic applications, it is important to
  be able to move to more realistic data. For this reason, the proposed approach
  temporally detects intervals where individual or social activity is occurring.
  Recognition of human activities is a key feature for analysing the human
  behaviour. In particular, recognition of social activities is useful to
  trigger human-robot interactions or to detect situations of potential danger.
  Based on that, this research has three goals: (1) define a new set of
  descriptors, which are able to characterise human interactions; (2) develop a
  computational model to segment temporal intervals with social interaction or
  individual behaviour; (3) provide a public dataset with RGB-D data with
  continuous stream of individual activities and social interactions. Results
  show that the proposed approach attained relevant performance with temporal
  segmentation of social activities."
