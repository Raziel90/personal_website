This is a social interaction dataset between two subjects. This dataset consists of RGB and depth images, and tracked skeleton data (i.e. joints 3D coordinates and rotations) acquired by an RGB-D sensor. It includes 8 social activities: {handshake, greeting hug, help walk, help stand-up, fight, push, conversation, call attention}. Each activity was recorded in a period around 40 to 60 seconds of repetitions within the same session at a frame rate of 30 frames per second. The only exceptions are help walking (at a short distance) and help stand-up, which were recorded 4 times to the same session, regardless of the time spent on it.

The activities were selected to address the assisted living scenario (e.g. happening in a health care environment: help walking, help stand-up and call attention), with potential harm situations, such as aggression (e.g. fighting, pushing), and casual activities of social interactions (e.g. handshake, greeting hug and conversation). The activities were performed by 6 persons, 4 males and  2 females with an average age of  29 years old, from different nationalities (Italian, Brazilian and Portuguese). A total of 10 different combinations of individuals (or sessions) were performed, with variation of the roles (active or passive person) between the subjects. Each subject has participated at least with 3 combinations, acting each role at least once. Half of the recorded sessions have been performed by a pair of persons whom never met before the interaction, This was done in order to increase the generalization of the study regarding individual behavior.

#### Dataset structure, download and conditions of use
The dataset is composed of 10 sessions. Each session provides RGB-D images and skeleton tracks of 8 different activities performed by two people. Each session is zipped in a separate file, which contains a folder that has skeleton tracks in a text format and RGB (24 bits) and depth (both 8 and 16 bit resolution) images. Each row of the skeleton text file contains information about positions (6 DoF) of 15 joints.
